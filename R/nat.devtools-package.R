#' @details \bold{nat.devtools} is built on top of the \code{\link{usethis}}
#'   package. It shares the key concept of the active package. If you are using
#'   Rstudio to develop a single package, then all should be fine. If you need
#'   to change between different packages, check out the
#'   \code{usethis::\link{proj_utils}} dcoumentation.
#'
#'   You can start by running \code{\link{nat_setup_package}}, which should do
#'   everything for a complete package setup. More specialised functions are
#'   available for selected tasks once you already have a package setup.
